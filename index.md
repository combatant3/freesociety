## Welcome to a Free Society

This isn't a very interesting website. I created it mostly to use as a blog for my own personal ideas, memoirs, and tutorials. If you find it useful, great!

A lot of the things I talk about on here are very opinionated and revolve around my own personal interests and hobbies. I strongly encourage anyone reading these posts to do their own research beforehand and take my word with a grain of salt.

### Other Resources

Here's a list of a bunch of other resources I encourage you to check out on your own time. I can personally attest to their integrity and validity, but again, think for yourself and no one else.
